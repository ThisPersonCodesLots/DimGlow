- It's used primarily for reducing eye strain when using a laptop screen in dark environments (e.g. in bed, on a plane, etc.).

- Also for reducing the amount of light emitted from the screen to improve battery life.

#### Behind the scenes
- The main reason for creating this application was to learn how to use the Win32 API in C# and to get rid of the annoying blue light filter that comes with Windows 11.
